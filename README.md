## Customization

To personalize this portfolio for yourself:

1.  **Replace Placeholders:** Update `[Your Name]`, `[yourusername]`, `[youremail@example.com]`, `[your-repo-name]`, and any other placeholder text with your own information.
2.  **Profile Photo:** Replace `https://placehold.co/150x150/e2e8f0/475569?text=Your+Photo` with the URL to your actual profile image.
3.  **Project Details:** Update the `project-card` elements with your own project images, titles, descriptions, and links to your live demos and GitHub repositories.
4.  **Skills:** Modify the `skill-item` elements to reflect your specific technical skills and relevant Font Awesome icons.
5.  **Social Links:** Update the `href` attributes for all social media icons (GitHub, LinkedIn, Twitter, Email) with your actual profile URLs.
6.  **Hero Name Hover Texts:** Change the `data-hover-texts` attribute on the `<span>` with `id="name-highlight"` in `index.html` to your desired hover words (e.g., `data-hover-texts="Coder,Creator,Innovator"`).
7.  **Colors & Fonts:** Adjust the CSS variables in the `:root` and `body.dark-mode` selectors within the `<style>` block to match your preferred color scheme. Update Google Fonts links if you wish to use different fonts.
8.  **Contact Form (Backend):** For a truly functional contact form, you'll need to integrate a backend solution (e.g., Node.js with Nodemailer, a serverless function, or a third-party form service like Formspree, Netlify Forms, etc.).
